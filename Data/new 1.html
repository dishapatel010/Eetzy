<hr><p>
Electronic music parties/events/festivals are not new to Goa and much earlier pioneers of free party's/events/festivals with live DJ's mixing, 
art,craft's and food stalls started in the late 1980s and continued through all of the 1990s into the early 2000s where they played Goa trance,
 Psychedelic trance, and Techno and were held at Vagator Beach, Anjuna beach and Arambol beach. The arrival of commercialized events such as Sunburn 
 arrived in Goa when mainstream electronic dance music gained more widespread popularity within India.
