hello, everyone, this is team algorithm and machine learning simulators.
this is the team chetas, Suhas and that's me aman, and mathang.
they are the team mentors Ashwin and Hardik.
Problem statement:

Our problem statement is to design a web application which dynamically simulates and explain step by step working of common algorithms like sorting and searching and also ML techniques which linear regression, k nearest neighbors and k means.
Motivation:


approach

here the question is how the product works or how 
the series of events happen?

complete chain of events begins with the user selecting the algorithm which they want to visualize, the user selects one, then the user is given an option either to mention the input manually or randomly assign the values whenever required if the user wishes to input the values then the given input is validated to avoid errors, and if the values are found to be correct, then these are passed into the appropriate function as parameters  where the actual functioning takes place and then the function returns data in a proper format which would help to visualize the algorithm in a much alluring way 



approach:
clarify the backend thing
we also have a section wherein users can log in and showcase algorithms that they have come up with. The users have to submit an HTML file. with all the logic within a script tag in it.
