>The main motivation to build this application occured to me,
>during the post lockdown classes held by the university, 
>where in, students were supposed to take the output of certain experiments with them 
>to make report and submit it later.
>the only option was to either save it in the drive or mail it to ourselves
>but the main problem, was to overcome the google's 2-step verification that 
>we were fed up of, so, I figured out a way out of this in the form of this site.
